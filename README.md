# Simply Math


## The Game to challenge yourself

The Idea for the game Simply Math I got from "Superschlau ausgerechnet" 
which I played as a child to improve my math skills. Superschlau was a Math Game in witch you could solve math equations and got points for correct answers.


## Instructions

- Easy to play, just solve the equation and click on the right answer.
  Cheers!
